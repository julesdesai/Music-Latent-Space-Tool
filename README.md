# Music-Latent-Space-Tool

WIP Flask App with Neural Backend designed for experimental work into musical cognition.

The Latent Space of an open weight pretrained generative music model is mapped onto a 2D (and soon a higher dim) surface that is visualised in the UI. Users are to click around the latent space which will generate loops of different kinds of music. They will be able to click and register their preferred loops. 

The data can then be used for statistical work on the extent of intersubjective musical agreement, and for general work on musical preference distribution. 

In the future, it may also be interesting to explore multimodal connections, with similar visual analogues to the tool, and also linguistic analogues on preferences of the aesthetic qualities of words, etc.
